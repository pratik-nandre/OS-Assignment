Concepts of Operating System
Assignment 1

Problem 1: Read the instructions carefully and answer accordingly. If there is
any need to insert some data then do that as well.
a) Navigate and List:
a. Start by navigating to your home directory and list its contents. Then, move into a
directory named "LinuxAssignment" if it exists; otherwise, create it.
sol:- rakesh@Rakesh:~$ mkdir LinuxAssigenment

b) File Management:
a. Inside the "LinuxAssignment" directory, create a new file named "file1.txt". Display its
contents.
sol:- cd LinuxAssigenment 
	cat > file1.txt Hello World

c) Directory Management:
a. Create a new directory named "docs" inside the "LinuxAssignment" directory.
sol:- rakesh@Rakesh:~/LinuxAssigenment$ mkdir docs

d) Copy and Move Files:
a. Copy the "file1.txt" file into the "docs" directory and rename it to "file2.txt".
sol:- cp file1.txt docs
	cd docs
	mv file1.txt file2.txt

e) Permissions and Ownership:
a. Change the permissions of "file2.txt" to allow read, write, and execute permissions for
the owner and only read permissions for others. Then, change the owner of "file2.txt" to
the current user.
sol:- chmod 744 file2.txt
	chown $user:$user file2.txt
	

f) Final Checklist:
a. Finally, list the contents of the "LinuxAssignment" directory and the root directory to
ensure that all operations were performed correctly.
SOL:- ls /
	cd ..

g) File Searching:
a. Search for all files with the extension ".txt" in the current directory and its subdirectories.
SOL:- find -name "*.txt"

b. Display lines containing a specific word in a file (provide a file name and the specific
word to search).
SOL:- grep "Hello" file1.txt

h) System Information:
a. Display the current system date and time.
SOL:- date

i) Networking:
a. Display the IP address of the system.
SOL:- ifconfig
 
b. Ping a remote server to check connectivity (provide a remote server address to ping).
SOL:- ping www.google.com

j) File Compression:
a. Compress the "docs" directory into a zip file.
SOL:- zip doc.zip docs

b. Extract the contents of the zip file into a new directory.
SOL:- unzip doc.zip -d doc1

k) File Editing:
a. Open the "file1.txt" file in a text editor and add some text to it.
SOL:- vi file1.txt
	(Esc + i)
	#!/bin/sh
	echo "Hello World"
	pwd
	ls
	(Esc+ :wq)

b. Replace a specific word in the "file1.txt" file with another word (provide the original
word and the word to replace it with).
SOL :- sed -i 's/World/C-DAC/g' file1.txt


Problem 2: Read the instructions carefully and answer accordingly. If there is
any need to insert some data then do that as well.

a. Suppose you have a file named "data.txt" containing important information. Display the
first 10 lines of this file to quickly glance at its contents using a command.
SOL:- rakesh@Rakesh:~/LinuxAssigenment$ cat > data.txt

b. Now, to check the end of the file for any recent additions, display the last 5 lines of
"data.txt" using another command.
SOL:- tail -5 data.txt
	21
	22
	23
	24
	25

c. In a file named "numbers.txt," there are a series of numbers. Display the first 15 lines of
this file to analyze the initial data set.
SOL:- cat > number.txt

d. To focus on the last few numbers of the dataset, display the last 3 lines of "numbers.txt".
SOL:- tail -3 number.txt
	208
	209
	210

e. Imagine you have a file named "input.txt" with text content. Use a command to translate
all lowercase letters to uppercase in "input.txt" and save the modified text in a new file
named "output.txt."
SOL:- rakesh@Rakesh:~/LinuxAssigenment$ cat > input.txt
	a b c d e f g h i
	rakesh@Rakesh:~/LinuxAssigenment$ tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' <input.txt> output.txt
	cat output.txt
	A B C D E F G H I

f. In a file named "duplicate.txt," there are several lines of text, some of which are
duplicates. Use a command to display only the unique lines from "duplicate.txt."
SOL:- rakesh@Rakesh:~/LinuxAssigenment$ cat > duplicate.txt
	aa
	aa
	aa
	aa
	bb
	bb
	cc
	cc
	d
	d
	ee
	ee
		uniq duplicate.txt
	aa
	bb
	cc
	d

g. In a file named "fruit.txt," there is a list of fruits, but some fruits are repeated. Use a
command to display each unique fruit along with the count of its occurrences in
"fruit.txt."
SOL:- rakesh@Rakesh:~/LinuxAssigenment$ cat > fruit.txt
	greps

	apple
	mango
	banana
